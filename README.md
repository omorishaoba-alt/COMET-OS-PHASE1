## Phase I Canvas

**Pilot Project:** Nigeria (BVN/NIN identity verification).  
**Distribution:** Google Play Store, users download, interact, generate QR receipts.  
**Core Mechanism:** QR receipts affirm participation, verification, and ROI; immutable & auditable.  
**Receipts:** Participation Receipt & Recommendation Receipt (system-generated).  
**Investor Assurance:** Proof of payment, purpose, status, recourse; works independently of the founder.  
**Anti-Fraud:** No fund circulation, no returns promised, immutable QR receipts.  
**Financial Institutions:** **ILLIQUID** if mortgage cannot be created after verified title and insurance.  
**Phase I Focus:** Play Store deployment, stable AI verification, QR receipt generation.  
**Legal & Regulatory:** No investment solicitation, monetisation is service-based (receipt possession).  
**Owner / Operator:** First Standard Title Limited (FSTL) – neutral, infallible, self-executing.

## Funding Goals
- Phase I goal: **$2.5 million (~₦X,XXX,XXX,XXX)** to fully demonstrate COMET OS capability.  
- Funds are **bootstrapped by FSTL**; realistic and sufficient for deployment.  
- Crowdfunding provides investors with **proof of participation** via QR-embedded receipts.

> Investors can verify the system works **autonomously**. The OS generates immutable, auditable receipts without founder intervention.

## How COMET OS Works
1. **INPUT:** Property and identity data (BVN/NIN or equivalents).  
2. **TRANSFORMATION:** AI verification of title, title insurance, and mortgage insurance.  
3. **OUTPUT:** QR-embedded receipt confirming verification and proof of participation.  

---

## Investor Proof & Assurance
- Each QR receipt contains **timestamp, investor name, amount, and unique hash**.  
- Receipts are **immutable and auditable**; they demonstrate COMET OS performance repeatedly.  
- The system is **self-sufficient**: no manual intervention required to validate participation.

## Notes
- COMET OS is an **infrastructure tool**, not a speculative token or promise of return.  
- Phase I demonstrates the **system’s performance**, which **galvanises investor confidence**.  
- Once on **Google Play Store**, crowdfunding becomes **simple, repeatable, and transparent**.
