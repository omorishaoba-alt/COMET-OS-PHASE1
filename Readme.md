# COMET OS Phase I - Public Verification & Investor Assurance

## About COMET OS
COMET OS is a land and property verification operating system designed for underdeveloped economies. It autonomously converts verified assets into capital and generates **QR-embe
dded receipts** to prove investor participation.

## Phase I Funding - $2.5 Million Target
**Objective:** Scale COMET OS deployment starting with the Nigeria pilot.  

**Investor Assurance:**
- Each payment generates a **QR-embedded DOCX receipt** (immutable, verifiable, timestamped).  
- Payments translate into **preference units**—recorded automatically by the system.  
- Fully autonomous; works **without founder involvement**.  

**Why Invest Now:**
- The OS is already built and tested.  
- Proof-of-concept exists for investors: e.g., verification of **No. 19 Egbor Avenue**.  
- First-mover advantage with **preference units** before full-scale rollout.  

**Phase I Focus:**
1. Google Play Store deployment  
2. Stable AI verification  
3. QR receipt generation  
4. Transparent and infallible execution
